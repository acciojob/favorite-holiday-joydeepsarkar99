		<p>Gangtok, city, capital of Sikkim state, northeastern India. It lies on a tributary of the Tista River in the southeast-central part of the state at an elevation of about 5,600 feet (1,700 metres).The city’s name means “Top of the Hill.” Gangtok rises over slopes extensively terraced in corn (maize). It was the governmental seat of the kingdom of Sikkim until the monarchy was abolished (1975) and Sikkim was annexed by India (1976). The city’s population includes Nepalese, Tibetans, Lepchas, and Indians. In the early 21st century a number of communities surrounding Gangtok were amalgamated administratively under the Gangtok Municipal Corporation, which significantly increased the area of the city and its population.</p>
